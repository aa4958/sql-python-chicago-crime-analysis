# Data README

This directory is intentionally left empty in this repository to keep the repo lightweight.

To reproduce the analysis:

1. Download the following CSV datasets from official sources:
   - ChicagoCensusData.csv
   - ChicagoCrimeData.csv
   - ChicagoPublicSchools.csv

2. Place them into the `data/` directory at the project root.

These datasets are required for loading into the SQLite database in the accompanying notebook and script.
